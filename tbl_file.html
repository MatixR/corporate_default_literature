Further, illustrates how not doing this can imply bias with a small example thus implying a huge crituque of previous studies. Compares a model with previous used models. Lags accounting variables.

This complicates the estimation method as the pseudo likelihood is no longer decomposable. Thus, likelihood evaluation is done by particle filter and parameter estimation is changed to a Baysian setup. Show that the new model has similar AUC but better aggregate estimates and wider aggregate confidance bounds. The frailty follows an AR(1) process. Frailty estimates suggests a close to random walk model. <br> There are made some comments throughout that does not seem supported to me.

			<td>Models US firms from from 1979 to 2004 with a cox model with constant or a frailty baseline and with both firm speicific and macro economics variables. Models are estimated with with an EM algorithm using MCMC with a Gibss sampler. The shared frailty variable is an  Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. The adding the frailty makes little difference in the estimates. As the authors write: 'Allowing for frailty does not add significantly to firm-by-firm default prediction'. <br> Further, they also provide a Baysian analysis for the model parameters. Their results suggest that MLE estimates may provide do not account for skew in the parameter distribution. I am not sure how much their choice of prior effects this results. <br> The sample seems small compared to other paper. I gather it is because the firms need to have an entry in the Moody's data base. <br> It is not clear to me what they do in the `Portfolio Default Quantile Tests` section. I gather they must use the parameter estimates for the whole sample period which likely affects their results (otherwise how do you get results for 1980). Moreover, I do not get what 'quantiles of the conditional distributions of the total number of defaults' is and how this yields 0-1 y-axis where 1 is bad from what I gather. <br> They (seem) to use the random covaraites from Duffie (2007) for forecasts.

The latter is new compared to Azizpour et al. (2008) at seems like a reasonable way to weight defaults. The estimation method has also been changed to a filtered likelihood method rather than grid search. <br> Find that both contagion and frailty is important.

			<td> 4</td>
			<td>Models aggreagate defaults count for US firms. The models includes both frailty and contagion. The intensity is a CIR process (which gives the frailty) with a term added with a weight function taking the counts of defaults as input (which gives the contagion). Different functions of the number of events is used for the contagion effect. See page 15. The two terms though mean that the 'frailty' is no longer a pure 'frailty' term as it leads to contagion. <br> I am not sure whether or not their test or estimation methods are a good idea. Using grid search on 5 dimension parameter space seems tedious. Further, why should the exponential decay weight parameter be the same for both terms? They get 1374 defaults which seems like a lot compared to other papers that use Moody's data base. I gather this is because they do not need data from Compustat and CRSP. It is questionable though how comparable this make the paper with others. <br> Some notes that may be useful when reading: <br> - Zero-factor: Hawkess process (i.e., no 'frailty' term). <br> - One-factor: CIR process with contagion effect. <br> - One-factor w/ covariates: add one of the covariates (macro variables) to the intensity. It is not clear to me how the covariate affects the intensity. Does it just enter linearly? I will need to read up on this part. <br> They find that adding the 'frailty' term '... does not improve the fit'. Make out-sample test and find what seems like decent results (see figure 10). <br> I would hesitate to conclude that this also applies for firms specefic models rather than default counting process. The paper may be interesting if you want to model aggregate counts.</td>
