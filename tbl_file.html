			<td>This is a Ph.D. thesis for a study of  bankruptcy prediction <br> It provides are good framework for formalizing the model building (see page 26) with a comprehensive literature review of each step. There is 20 pages of references which stress the latter point <br> Quite readable <br> One can skip the study though as: <br> I find that this is one of the best introduction into bankeruptcy prediction although it is long <br> I am not convinced that the dynamic variables introduced on page 92 is good idea. I assume they will be quite unstable for firms with little prior data (which motivaties the treatment of outliers later). They do not seem useful to when you look at the results at table 113 <br> Excluding 'Companies which hadn?t been realizing sales for at least two consecutive' may not a be a good idea <br> The treatment of outliers seems questionable to me.

Large part of the article can be skipped if you only care about the details for their model <br> The following may be a good idea since the variable is used in the denomintor: 'we add 10% of the difference between market and book equity to the book value of total assets, thereby increasing book values that are extremely small and probably mismeasured' <br> This might be a bit more questionable: 'Just under 2% of firm-months still have negative values for book equity even after this adjustment, and we replace these negative values with small positive values of $1 to ensure that the market-to-book ratios for these firms are in the right tail, not the left tail, of the distribution.' <br> This may be a good idea: 'each firm?s log price per share, truncated above at $15 (PRICE).' <br> They add lagged profitablity and excess stock return with  geometrically declining weights the lags. The lag is set to 2^(-1/3) which is kind of abiritraty in addiontion to the number of terms they include.

			<td>Uses expected default frequency (EDF) as proxy for defaults. Shows how EDF can be linked to liquidity. They perform a difference-in-difference study where they use propensity scores to get proxy for a control and treatment groups setup. This build their argument for a causal link. They end by showing to possible reasons for why liquidity will effect the likelihood of default. <br> I have many critiques of / comments to this paper. <br> 1. EDF is 'ok' for default ranking but a very poor estimate of absolute risk. For instance, the 6 pct. mean chance of yearly default (cf. table 2) is way off. The chance should be less than .1 pct. <br> 2. I gather the matching with propensity scores may yield underiserable effects.

The intensity is a CIR process (which gives the frailty) with a term added for the counts of defaults (which gives the contagion). Different functions of the number of events is used for the contagion effect <br> They use two macro economic variables in addition in the modelling (3 month Treasury bill yield and the trailing 1 year return on the S&P 500 index). I guess a CIR process for the treasury bill and geomatric brownian motions for the S&P returns is an ok choice for the models for these <br> I am not sure whether or not their test or estimation methods are a good idea. I would have to read up on counting process to evaluate this <br> The two variables add little information to the model. Finds that the Hawkess process work rather well <br> I would hesitate to conclude that this also applies for firms specefic models rather than default counting process. The paper may be interesting if you want to model aggregate counts.
