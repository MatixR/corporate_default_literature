In the  last decades Artificial Neural Networks have been widely used for this task. These models  have the advantage of being able to detect non-linear relationships and show a good  performance in presence of noisy information, as it usually happens, in corporate failure  prediction problems. AdaBoost is a novel ensemble learning algorithm that constructs its  ..."

The aim of predicting financial distress is to  develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures and allows to  foresee a financial condition of a firm. In this domain various methods were proposed that  were based on statistical hypothesis testing, statistical modeling (eg, generalized linear  ..."

"A Combination Use of Bagging and Random Subspace with Memory Mechanism for Dynamic Financial Distress Prediction" "Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management " "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7798055/" "2016" "0" "Abstract: On account of great significance of financial distress prediction for corporations, it is  essential to construct an effective prediction model for managers and investors. Traditional  financial distress prediction methods design static models using samples within a period of  time, but the static models are insensitive to changes, such as concept drift in financial  distress. This paper proposed a dynamic prediction framework called multi-layer  ..."
"Additive Intensity Regression Models in Corporate Default Analysis" "JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS" "http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/443.short" "2013" "4" "Abstract We consider additive intensity (Aalen) models as an alternative to the multiplicative  intensity (Cox) models for analyzing the default risk of a sample of rated, nonfinancial US  firms. The setting allows for estimating and testing the significance of time-varying effects.  We use a variety of model checking techniques to identify misspecifications. In our final  model, we find evidence of time-variation in the effects of distance-to-default and short-to- ..."
"Forecasting Bankruptcy More Accurately: A Simple Hazard Model" "The Journal of Business" "http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209665" "2001" "1968" "I argue that hazard models are more appropriate than single-period models for forecasting  bankruptcy. Single-period models are inconsistent, while hazard models produce consistent  estimates. I describe a simple technique for estimating a discrete-time hazard model. I find  that about half of the accounting ratios that have been used in previous models are not  statistically significant. Moreover, market size, past stock returns, and idiosyncratic returns  ..."
