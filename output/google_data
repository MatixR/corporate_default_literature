This paper applies support vector machines (SVMs) to the  bankruptcy prediction problem in an attempt to suggest a new model with better explanatory  power and stability. To serve this purpose, we use a grid-search technique using 5-fold  ..."

Traditional  financial distress prediction methods design static models using samples within a period of  time, but the static models are insensitive to changes, such as concept drift in financial  distress. This paper proposed a dynamic prediction framework called multi-layer  ..."
