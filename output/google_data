However, there are no consistent results to show that one technique is better than  the other. Different techniques have different advantages and disadvantages on different  ..."

Feature reduction methods are first applied to reduce the ratios used in  the prediction. Then, various classification methods, including discriminant analysis, neural  networks, decision tree induction, learning vector quantization, rough sets, and isotonic  separation, are used with the reduced ratios. Experiments show that the isotonic  ..." "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:IM1wBUDYqUYJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&oe=ASCII&as_sdt=0,5"
