Use macro economics variables
As rightly mentioned, the banks may introduce a selection bias with which firms that are in the sample
May provide evidence that larger firms are more homogeneous and their credit risk depends more on the fnancial indicators of
the company

Cons:
Including a dummy variable for all the years from age 1, 2, 3, ..., 24 a category for +25 seems alarming to me
The continuous dropping of variable (including age factor levels) based on arguments like: '... we did not include the liquidity positon of microenterprises, since we are not convinced that greater liquidity would directly increase the credit risk of a company'
Comparing estimates signs and magnitudes with different specification of the linear predictor due to the previous comment

Use change in accoutning variables. Might be good idea though I figure these should be relative and not abosolute when used in logistic regression
