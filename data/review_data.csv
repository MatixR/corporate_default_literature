One can skip the study though as:
I find that this is one of the best introduction into bankeruptcy prediction although it is long
I am not convinced that the dynamic variables introduced on page 92 is good idea. I assume they will be quite unstable for firms with little prior data (which motivaties the treatment of outliers later). They do not seem useful to when you look at the results at table 113
Excluding 'Companies which hadn?t been realizing sales for at least two consecutive' may not a be a good idea

They use two macro economic variables in addition in the modelling (3 month Treasury bill yield and the trailing 1 year return on the S&P 500 index). I guess a CIR process for the treasury bill and geomatric brownian motions for the S&P returns is an ok choice for the models for these

The article is very accessible article. Some of the adjustments and changes are mentioned below. Large part of the article can be skipped if you only care about the details for their model
The following may be a good idea since the variable is used in the denomintor: 'we add 10% of the difference between market and book equity to the book value of total assets, thereby increasing book values that are extremely small and probably mismeasured'
This might be a bit more questionable: 'Just under 2% of firm-months still have negative values for book equity even after this adjustment, and we replace these negative values with small positive values of $1 to ensure that the market-to-book ratios for these firms are in the right tail, not the left tail, of the distribution.'
This may be a good idea: 'each firm?s log price per share, truncated above at $15 (PRICE).'
They add lagged profitablity and excess stock return with  geometrically declining weights the lags. The lag is set to 2^(-1/3) which is kind of abiritraty in addiontion to the number of terms they include. See page 13
Change the denominator in some of the ratios from total assets to book value
Add two more variables
The inclusion of the averages with geomtric weights and descission like the next phrase makes me wonder how much data dredging they have done:' Exploratory analysis suggests that price per share is relevant below $15, and so we winsorize price per share at this level before taking the log.'

It is not clear to me why they only use some dummy and covariate interactions and not others. I.e. why is there not an interaction term between say EXRET and industry?
It may worth to look at the following comment if you are goind to use industry variables '... there are a few well-known problems with the SIC codes as reported by both COMPUSTAT and CRSP (see ...'
In addition they also extend the data set of Shumway (2001) with firms listed on NASDAQ, test models with financial firms and test monthly forecast models

I don?t see why they exclude the utility firms and sample the non-bankerupt firms. The articles is from 2006 so estimating the logit a model for the full sample should be durable
I guess including Current Assets/Total Assets and Cash/Total Assets could lead to multicollinearity issues
Uses lagged year default rates based on two digits SIC codes. May be a good idea though I figure som of the two digits SIC codes groups will be sparse. The issues with the two digits level is further stressed in this later comment:' The average annual industry failure rate is 1.35%. Note that some high industry failure rates are driven by the small number of firms existing in the industry' 
Uses cutoffs and Estimated Misclassification Cost (EMC) which I am not a fan of due to the arbitrariness of the relative cost and cutoff level
I do not get why they add 'the composite stress measure' instead of just including the terms. E.g. for Zmijewski probability which consists of a lot of variables they already include and an rather arbitrary cutoff of 28% 
I do not get this comment when they bootstrap the EMC:' There is no need to randomly select bankrupt firms since they are deterministic'

Further, I recall reading about other models for predicting accounting data which does fairly well. These could be used in place as the covariate process is assumed independent

There are three group of latent variables: one shared by macro variables and linear predictors for defaults, one for fraitly with different loadings for each rating group and one for ratings and industry interactions. The latter is refered to as contagion. Differnt loadings to each factor is estimated
Show that both frailty and contagion is important to model aggregate levels
I have to major comments to the study: 1) parameters are based on the full sample (I think) and 2) I do not think the use of rating agency scores is to good. I re-call reading that the AUC of rating scores in terms of default is quite poor

The model is too hard to estimate for many macroeconomic variables according to the author so he only uses GNP per capita in the end

I have see a few downsites to the paper:
- Firms that are eventually merged or aqquired might be removed from the sample (this would explain the sample size). This is not done in the main cited papers
- Default indicator might explain the low count of defaults. Other authors have done more regiourse work
- I would assume that the local log-likelihood approach will be inappropiate when macroeconomic variable with a drift is used as is the case for GDP per capita (the kernal are going to provide no mass in the end)
- The outsample metric is aggregate predicted count of defaults. While the results are good they may be very poor for any given firm. An out-sample AUC or similar would have been good

This build their argument for a causal link. They end by showing to possible reasons for why liquidity will effect the likelihood of default.

I have many critiques of / comments to this paper. 
1. EDF is 'ok' for default ranking but a very poor estimate of absolute risk. For instance, the 6 pct. mean chance of yearly default (cf. table 2) is way off. The chance should be less than .1 pct.
2. I gather the matching with propensity scores may yield underiserable effects. I gather we migth get a unrepresentative sample of the whole population. 
3. I do not have the background to judge the event they use. 
4. I do not have the knowledge to judge the liquidity messaures they use.
