They get only a slight improvment in AUC by including macro economic variables. They select five industry and add intercept and slopes for each industry kinda like in Chava et al (2004). They '... conduct simple t-tests to check whether variables [industry slopes and intercepts] are found to be significant' and exclude variables on the basis hereof. I figure this must be on the full sample which may inflate their perform metrics later. They finds small improvments in in-sample AUC and decile ranking out-sample (in time).",4,,,,,,

Self-exciting corporate defaults: contagion vs. frailty,"Manuscript, Stanford University","SMR, CO, FR","US firms from 1970 to 2006
Defaults from Moody's Default Risk Service
Firms issues are included if it '... is not a sovereign and has a senior rating'
Their default definition seems broad to me (see page 6 under data). For example '51% of the defaults are due to missed interest payments'",None,"6048 firms in 2006
1374 defaults through out the period",,"Models aggreagate defaults count for US firms. The models includes both frailty and contagion. The intensity is a CIR process (which gives the frailty) with a term added with a weight function taking the counts of defaults as input (which gives the contagion). Different functions of the number of events is used for the contagion effect. See page 15. The two terms though mean that the 'frailty' is no longer a pure 'frailty' term as it leads to contagion.

I am not sure whether or not their test or estimation methods are a good idea. Using grid search on 5 dimension parameter space seems tedious. Further, why should the exponential decay weight parameter be the same for both terms? They get 1374 defaults which seems like a lot compared to other papers that use Moody's data base. I gather this is because they do not need data from Compustat and CRSP. It is questionable though how comparable this make the paper with others.

Some notes that may be useful when reading: 
- Zero-factor: Hawkess process (i.e., no 'frailty' term).
- One-factor: CIR process with contagion effect.
- One-factor w/ covariates: add one of the covariates (macro variables) to the intensity. It is not clear to me how the covariate affects the intensity. Does it just enter linearly? I will need to read up on this part. 

They find that adding the 'frailty' term '... does not improve the fit'. Make out-sample test and find what seems like decent results (see figure 10).   

I would hesitate to conclude that this also applies for firms specefic models rather than default counting process. The paper may be interesting if you want to model aggregate counts.",4,,,,,,

I do not get why they split the firms into a train and test data-set. You can easily do cross-validation later?

Use lagged year default rates based on two digits SIC codes. May be a good idea though I figure som of the two digits SIC codes groups will be sparse. Use cutoffs and Estimated Misclassification Cost (EMC) which I am not a fan of due to the arbitrariness of the relative cost and cutoff level.

E.g. for Zmijewski probability which consists of a lot of variables they already include and an rather arbitrary cutoff of 28 pct. 

I do not get this comment when they bootstrap the EMC:' There is no need to randomly select bankrupt firms since they are deterministic'. I will need to read up on the bootsrap procedure on page 73.

Financial distress is defined as 'specially treated (ST) by Chinese Stock Exchange due to abnormal financial status'. That is two period of negative income or a further condition on the market to book ratio","Matching method is utilized to choose normal
non-financial-distress companies according to the following rules.
(1) The matched two companies have the same or similar industry.
(2) The chosen normal company should never be specially treated.
(3) The matched two companies should have similar asset size in the range of [-30%, +30%]'",135 / 135 firms with what I guess is 1 set of accounting statements for each firm ,82% accuracy out sample based on 30 times hold out experimints. The split is 2:1 strafied by distress or not. Though see the comment in my review about the ensamble training,"Makes an ensamble of SVM with different feature spaces and different kernals functions
Reduce the final ensamble with Q diversity meassure in a greedy process. The final predicition is based on weighted voting
The feature selection seems questionable to me. While I do get why you would use PCA as you are going to use L2 norms later I do not see why you would use stepwise regression with multiple descrimination analysis or logistic regression to select features
Feature selection is based on the entire population in hold-out test. See page 8 for details
Use matched sampling
This may not be a good pratice 'Sample companies with financial ratios deviating from the mean value as much as three times of standard deviation are excluded'
If I get what they are saying on page 7 correclty ('candidate classifiers with relatively high cross validation accuracy on training dataset') then the ensamble is trained on the final testing data. If this is the case than it does not seem strange that the performance improves with the ensamble

This complicates the estimation method as the pseudo likelihood is no longer decomposable. Thus, likelihood evaluation is done by particle filter and parameter estimation is changed to a Baysian setup. Show that the new model has similar AUC but better aggregate estimates and wider aggregate confidance bounds. The frailty follows an AR(1) process. Frailty estimates suggests a close to random walk model. 

There are made some comments throughout that does not seem supported to me. E.g. the comparisons of log-pseudo likelihood with models with different penalization without adjustment.

Somehow, the out sample figures are better than in-sample on longer horizon. Also better than 2012 paper I think for the same model. I think the PC-M model should have the coefficients for the matricies in (19) but I dont find the values of these. I would have to look at both the estimaton methods and the inference in more details.

Aggregate defaults are from Moody's and macro variables are from St. Louis Fed online database,None,Not specified,See my review,"Models aggregate US defaults rates in a state space setup. Defaults are group in two levels: one is by agent ratings and the other is by industry. There are three group of latent variables: one shared by macro variables and linear predictors for defaults, one for fraitly with different loadings for each rating group and one for ratings and industry interactions. The latter is refered to as contagion. Differnt loadings to each factor is estimated. Show that both frailty and contagion is important to model aggregate levels.

A few comments are
 - parameters are based on the full sample (I think).
 - I do not think the use of rating agency scores is to good. I re-call reading that the AUC of rating scores in terms of default is quite poor. It may affect their results if the rankings are off to start.",3,,,,,,

Uses very similar model to Shumway (2001). The model is too hard to estimate for many macroeconomic variables according to the author so he only uses GNP per capita in the end. I see a few downsites to the paper 
- Firms that are eventually merged or aqquired might be removed from the sample (this would explain the sample size). This seems odd and may bias the result. C.f., page 680. 
- Default indicator might explain the low count of defaults. Other authors have done more regiourse work. I have not come across many other paper that uses the delisting code from CRSP.
- You have to select a bandwidth with the model. 
- I would assume that the local log-likelihood approach will be inappropiate when macroeconomic variable with a drift is used as is the case for GDP per capita (the kernal are going to provide no mass in the end). 
- The out-sample metric is absolute difference between aggregate predicted defaults and the realised. While the results are good they may be very poor for any given firm. An out-sample AUC or similar would have been good.

This build their argument for a causal link. They end by showing to possible reasons for why liquidity will effect the likelihood of default.

I have many critiques of / comments to this paper. 
1. EDF is 'ok' for default ranking but a very poor estimate of absolute risk. For instance, the 6 pct. mean chance of yearly default (cf. table 2) is way off. The chance should be less than .1 pct.
2. I gather the matching with propensity scores may yield underiserable effects. I gather we migth get a unrepresentative sample of the whole population. 
3. I do not have the background to judge the event they use. 
4. I do not have the knowledge to judge the liquidity messaures they use.

The results are interesting espacially with the bundled products with comparissons with the rating agents. However, it would be intersting to see the out-sample performance of the methods.
